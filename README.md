# FocusMesh — A Cognitive-Aware Focus Companion

FocusMesh is a privacy-first, cognitive-aware browser extension designed to reduce digital overload, prevent mental spiraling, and help users maintain deep, sustainable focus.

Instead of blocking websites or enforcing productivity rules, FocusMesh understands user intent, detects early signs of cognitive overload, and gently nudges users back into clarity — all locally on the device.

## The Problem

Modern digital work leads to:

- Endless tab-hopping
- Doom scrolling
- Cognitive overload
- Task fragmentation
- Burnout disguised as productivity

Traditional productivity tools:

- Block websites blindly
- Ignore mental state
- Disrupt natural workflows
- Feel restrictive and stressful

---

## The Solution

FocusMesh acts as a digital cognitive partner, working with the user instead of controlling them.

## What FocusMesh Does

### 1. Single Active Task Mode
Users define one primary task (e.g., "Machine Learning Assignment").

FocusMesh:
- Checks whether open tabs align with the active task
- Visually flags irrelevant tabs without blocking them
- Encourages awareness rather than restriction

### 2. Smart Tab Grouping (MVP)
With one click, users can:
- Group irrelevant tabs together
- Instantly clean their workspace
- Reduce visual and mental clutter

### 3. Cognitive Temperature Engine (MVP)
Using lightweight behavioral signals such as:
- Tab switching frequency
- Scroll activity
- Interaction rhythm

FocusMesh computes a Cognitive Temperature:
- Low — calm focus
- Medium — attention drifting
- High — potential cognitive spiral

### 4. Local Intent-Based Tab Analysis
- Reads only visible page text
- Matches content relevance to the active task
- Runs entirely on-device
- No browsing history or cloud processing

### 5. Privacy by Design
- No servers
- No user tracking
- No data sharing
- 100% local execution
