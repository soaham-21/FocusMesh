FocusMesh — A Cognitive-Aware Focus Companion
FocusMesh is a privacy-first, cognitive-aware browser extension designed to prevent mental spiraling, reduce digital overload, and help students and professionals maintain deep, sustainable focus.

Instead of blocking the internet or forcing productivity, FocusMesh gently understands intent, detects early signs of cognitive overload, and nudges users back into clarity — all locally on the device.

The Problem
Modern digital work creates:

Endless tab-hopping
Doom scrolling
Cognitive overload
Task fragmentation
Burnout disguised as productivity
Traditional productivity tools:

Block websites blindly
Ignore mental state
Break natural workflows
Feel restrictive and stressful
FocusMesh solves this differently.

Our Solution (What FocusMesh Does)
FocusMesh acts like a digital cognitive partner.

1. Single Active Task Mode
Users define one primary task (e.g., “Machine Learning Assignment”).

The extension:

Continuously checks whether open tabs align with that task
Flags irrelevant tabs visually (without blocking)
Helps users stay aware, not controlled
2️. Smart Tab Grouping (MVP)
With one click, users can:

Group irrelevant tabs together
Clean their workspace instantly
Reduce visual and mental clutter
3️. Cognitive Temperature Engine (MVP)
Using lightweight behavioral signals such as:

Tab switching frequency
Scroll activity
Interaction rhythm
FocusMesh calculates a Cognitive Temperature score:

🟢 Low → calm focus
🟡 Medium → drifting
🔴 High → potential spiral
This helps detect overload before burnout begins.

4️. Local Intent-Based Tab Analysis
Reads only visible page text
Matches content relevance to the active task
Runs entirely on-device
No browsing history stored
No cloud processing
5️. Privacy by Design
 No servers
 No user tracking
 No data sharing
 100% local execution
 Full user control
 Tech Stack (Simple & Feasible)
Technology	Purpose
Chrome Extensions (Manifest V3)	Browser integration
JavaScript	Core logic
Chrome Tabs API	Tab relevance & grouping
Chrome Storage API	Local state management
HTML/CSS	Popup & UI
On-device heuristics	Cognitive temperature calculation
No AI model is required for MVP — ensuring speed, privacy, and feasibility.
